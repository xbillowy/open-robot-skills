description: NVIDIA cuRobo motion planning — collision-free trajectories to
  grasp goalsets, constrained linear moves, single-pose planning, and
  joint-trajectory collision validation.
  Use when a workflow needs
  GPU-accelerated, collision-aware arm motion plans.

# curobo

Collision-aware cuRobo motion planning as in-process tools. Trajectories
in/out are gap `Trajectory` dicts (`waypoints: [{positions:
float64[dof]}]`); worlds are gap `WorldConfig` dicts (build one with
`geometry.build_world_config`).

## When to use

- Tabletop pick: `geometry.top_down_grasp_candidates` →
  `curobo.plan_to_grasp_poses` (pass the whole fan as the goalset; check
  `goalset_index` for which one was reached).
- Drawers/doors: `curobo.plan_grasp_motion` (approach → grasp → lift/pull
  with gripper commands interleaved), or `curobo.plan_directed_linear` for
  a pull along one axis with orientation locked.

## Install

cuRobo JIT-compiles CUDA extensions at install time — build isolation must
be off and `CUDA_HOME` must point at a toolkit matching your torch build:

```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda     # toolkit matching torch's CUDA version
uv sync --extra curobo               # (pip: pip install -e ".[curobo]" --no-build-isolation)
```

If the import fails at tool-call time the tools raise a `ToolError` with
this recipe. First planner call per process pays JIT/warmup latency; the
MotionGen/planner instances are cached and reused (HyRL pattern — recreating
them per call corrupts CUDA graph state).

## Gotchas (carried over from the service + curobo_api)

- **Frames**: grasp/target poses are in the robot-base frame (cuRobo treats
  the robot base as world origin). With `grasp_pose_is_fingertip=True`
  (default) grasp positions are fingertip-pad centers and converted to the
  `panda_hand` frame solver-side (offset 0.1029 m along hand Z).
- **Ignore the grasp target**: pass its mesh name in
  `ignore_obstacle_names` for `plan_to_grasp_poses` — closing on the target
  is not a collision.
- `robot_collision_sphere_buffer` default −0.01 shrinks robot collision
  spheres 1 cm; reduces IK_FAIL against dense perception meshes. Negative
  is intentional.
- GPU access is serialised by a module lock (cuRobo is not thread-safe);
  CUDA/"graph capture" errors invalidate the cached planners automatically
  before raising `PlanningFailed`.
- `use_cuda_graph` must stay False for the validators
  (`check_start_state` requirement) and for varying world/start setups.
- **cuRobo version**: `plan_to_grasp_poses`, `plan_grasp_motion`,
  `plan_directed_linear`, `plan_linear`, and `plan_to_pose` target curobo
  v0.8 (MotionPlanner API). The removed v0.7-only `solve_ik`,
  `batch_grasp_feasibility`, and attached-object transport APIs are
  intentionally not registered. Plan via the supported goalset/pose tools
  instead. The validators use the v0.7 MotionGen path too.
- `validate_joint_trajectory_grasped` always invalidates the planner cache
  afterward so the attachment cannot leak; expect the next planning call to
  re-create the planner.
- Planning failures return `success=False` (with `failure_reason` where the
  RPC had one); infrastructure errors raise `PlanningFailed` / `ToolError`.
- Set `debug_out_dir` on the grasp/transport planners to dump world + robot
  sphere OBJ/PLY debug artifacts on failure (default `./curobo_debug*`).
