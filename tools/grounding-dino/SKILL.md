# grounding-dino

The Grounding DINO servicer (`IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-base` via
transformers) as one in-process tool. Image in: RGB uint8 `[H, W, 3]` numpy
array; out: `{detections: [{box, label, score}, ...]}`.

## Checked paper model artifact manifest

This identity was derived once from the locally cached Hugging Face snapshot;
runtime selection checks the immutable snapshot symlink and content-addressed
blob name without repeatedly hashing the 890 MB weight file.

```yaml
requested_model: IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-base
resolved_revision: 12bdfa3120f3e7ec7b434d90674b3396eccf88eb

```

## When to use

- Locating a named object in a camera frame: `grounding-dino.detect(rgb,
  "cream cheese box.")`, pick the best box (highest score, or closest to a
  pointing-model pixel), then `sam3.segment_box` for a pixel-accurate mask.
- Empty `detections` means nothing cleared the thresholds — treat as
  not-found, don't retry blindly with the same prompt.

## Install

```bash
uv sync --extra grounding-dino   # torch + transformers
# (pip: pip install -e ".[grounding-dino]")
```

Weights download from HuggingFace on first call. Env knobs:
`GAP_DINO_DEVICE` (default `cuda`; CPU works but is slow). The model name and
revision are intentionally not environment-overridable in the paper service.

## Gotchas (carried over from the servicer)

- **Period-separated phrases**: GDINO's text encoder expects each object
  phrase terminated with `.` (`"red cube. green cube."`). A missing final
  period is appended automatically, but separate multiple objects yourself.
- Default thresholds are deliberately low (0.20/0.20) for recall on
  household objects; raise them when false positives leak through. Zero or
  negative thresholds fall back to the defaults (proto-default semantics).
- `label` strings are the matched text spans, not your full query — when
  querying multiple phrases, group detections by label.
- The model is a lazy module-level singleton; the first call pays the
  weights-load latency, subsequent calls don't.
