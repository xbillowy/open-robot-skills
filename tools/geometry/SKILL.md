  top-down/front grasp poses, and reconstruct collision worlds from RGB-D
  frames. Use when a workflow needs perception geometry or planner inputs
  computed on CPU with no model weights.

# geometry

Pure-math perception/planning geometry as in-process typed tools, from
mask back-projection through OBB fitting to grasp-candidate generation,
plus the two scalar helpers (`geometry.iou`, `geometry.pose_distance`).
Fully CPU — no model weights, no GPU.

Paper-facing mask back-projection, filtering, OBB, and world-reconstruction
results include discriminated `algorithm_service` evidence. It binds the ORS
Git object, this bundle's `uv.lock`, effective parameters, runtime dependency
versions, inputs, and outputs. A dirty/unverifiable source checkout, all-noise
filter pass-through, non-7-DOF robot-exclusion skip, target-OBB projection, or
empty world reconstruction sets `fallback_used=true` and is not paper-admissible.
OBB fitting runs its legacy tiny jitter under an isolated fixed seed so evidence
and output hashes are repeatable without perturbing process-global RNG state.

## When to use

- Turning a segmentation mask + depth + camera calibration into world-frame
  points (`mask_to_world_points`) and an object OBB
  (`filter_and_compute_obb`).
- Deriving grasp poses from an OBB: `top_down_grasp_candidates` for tabletop
  pick (feed the full list to `curobo.plan_to_grasp_poses` as a goalset),
  `front_grasp_from_obb` for horizontal interactions (drawer/door handles).
- Building the collision world for the planner: `build_world_config` with the
  target's mask in `object_masks` so the planner can `ignore_obstacle_names`
  it.

## Install

```bash
uv sync --extra geometry   # open3d + scikit-learn (cv2/scipy come with gap core)
# (pip: pip install -e ".[geometry]")
```

The module imports lazily — the bundle loads (and the light tools work)
without the extra; only OBB fitting, DBSCAN filtering and world
reconstruction need open3d/sklearn/cv2.

## Gotchas (carried over from the service)

- **OBB `extent` is HALF-extents** (gap.types convention, same as the proto).
  `compute_obb` is upright-only: rotation is around world Z (no 3D tilt), and
  extents use the 2nd/98th percentile of points, not strict min/max.
- Single-camera clouds are 2.5D: only camera-facing surfaces are observed, so
  OBB centers carry a few cm of depth bias on opaque objects. (The service's
  rehearsal-sandbox ground-truth snap that compensated for this in-container
  was deliberately NOT ported — it depended on a `/app` sandbox file.)
- `top_down_grasp_candidates` default `z_offset=-0.04`: fingertip 4 cm below
  the OBB top. With `z_offset=0.0` the fingers close above the object
  (silent empty grip). Grasp Z is clamped to -0.05 m (table-clearance floor;
  LIBERO table top is at world z=0).
- `mask_to_world_points` keeps only depths in [0.015, 20.0] m (HyRL bounds);
  invalid/zero-depth pixels are dropped.
- `filter_noise` returns the ORIGINAL cloud unchanged when DBSCAN labels
  everything noise (defensive fallback, mirrors HyRL).
- `build_world_config`: table removal only runs when `table_z_threshold != 0`
  (typical -0.01); robot-point exclusion is Franka-only (simplified DH FK)
  and skips non-7-DOF joint states; prefer explicit `object_masks` over the
  `target_obb` projection fallback — masks are pixel-accurate, the OBB
  projection is a corner-AABB approximation inflated by 2 cm.
- `top_down_grasp_from_obb` yaw is NOT derived from the OBB — fingers may
  close across the wide axis; use the candidate fan when orientation matters.
